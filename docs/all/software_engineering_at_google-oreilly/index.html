<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>It is important to build not only scalable, BUT also sustainable software, that can adapt to potential changes, while been accessible to other devs</p>
<p>This book will also explore the difference between development AND engineering</p>
<ul>
<li>software is becoming more and more included into our day2day lives, so it is important to engineer it, not just develop and pray
<ul>
<li>thats for other engineers has practices and standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, here you can find processes, practices and tools, used by Google to achieve healthy codebase, that explored through this topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>effect of time over sustainability</li>
<li>effect of scale over viability</li>
<li>design trade-offs</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating software, remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>how code will adapt over time</li>
<li>how code will scale with business</li>
<li>what trade-offs can be adapted to scale faster OR grow in more sustainable manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Main topics will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google’s culture</li>
<li>Processes at scale</li>
<li>Tooling (internal AND open-source)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that this is all about the way, how Google operates, not one for all fit list of advices</p>
<h2 id="what-is-software-engineering">What is Software Engineering</h2>
<p>As software engineers, we have a responsibility to:</p>
<ul>
<li>think about time</li>
<li>think about scale</li>
<li>make complex decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, development is process of writing code, which, if combined with modification, maintenance and team-work, becomes software engineering</p>
<ul>
<li>often you need to decide how long-lived your program will be AND this will result in what will you do(program or engineer)</li>
<li>if you can’t adapt to potential changes, you create high risk situation for yourself</li>
<li>introducing several devs require process, BUT will benefit in long run</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember, that unsustainable practices will introduce deferred cost</p>
<h6 id="time-and-change">Time and Change</h6>
<p>As said, with scale comes need to adopt for more and more fundamental changes, and, if it is not done before-hand, it WILL back-fire hard, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are many hidden things, inside program, that will slow-down upgrade</li>
<li>it is not enough experience overall in this field</li>
<li>it is long and costly process, where you need to JUST do migration alone</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>to avoid, generally, invest in incremental updates</li>
<li>focus on possibility to overcome any update forward, not just first one, it is constant battle</li>
<li>remember that any dependency CAN and most often WILL change(usually because new feature, optimization or bug is found)</li>
<li>ideally, you need to reduce that cost of change, by paying upfront and investing in it overtime, OTHERWISE you have risk of been stuck in impossible to change state, where you defer to get more resource, but deferring causes more need of them
<ul>
<li>such problems often slowly become worse overtime, until hitting critical point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>never do changes for the sake of change</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="hyrums-law">Hyrum’s Law</h6>
<p>This law states, that no matter what contract defines, giving long enough time period, all observable behavior of public API will be depended-on by user</p>
<ul>
<li>ex: if you return internal details in error response, that aren’t defined by contract AND stopped, this will break someone, who decided to parse them</li>
<li>note: we can mitigate it, but never overcome</li>
<li>when deciding to change something, you must include the cost of mitigating breakage problems
<ul>
<li>it works both ways, ex: when using hash-map you can depend on order of items, BUT if you will it will make your code less sustainable; when changing algorithm behind your hash-map library, you eventually will cause bugs in someones code</li>
<li>generally, avoid been “clever”, don’t depend on implementation, depend on interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="policies">Policies</h6>
<p>Everything need to scale(codebase, dependencies, machines etc), including policies</p>
<p>Scaling problem can be spotted, if process can’t be automated, thus requiring more resources, with more scale</p>
<ul>
<li>remember, that scale of smth(ex: codebase) often will produce non-linear resource requirements(ex: number of maintainers), SO automation is even more important</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of bad policies and alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>force dependent teams to do migration — perform migration by dedicated team OR team of devs, that introduced need for migration</li>
<li>develop in large branches — trunk based development</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of good policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>if breaking change wasn’t detected by test suits before merge, this is not a problem of author, this is problem of test owner</li>
<li>knowledge sharing process</li>
<li>work on improvements of found problems, not just assume that they won’t repeat
<ul>
<li>this will make upstream changes easier and cheaper</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in general:
<ul>
<li>automate</li>
<li>isolate low-level details</li>
<li>share expertise</li>
<li>introduce improvements constantly</li>
<li>keep major policies well known</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="shifting-left">Shifting left</h6>
<p>It is cheaper to fix early problems, so it is important to invest in tools and polices, that will catch any problems on early stage of development</p>
<h6 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h6>
<p>Have a reason(often backed by data) to do something, don’t don for sake of doing OR “just because”</p>
<ul>
<li>in general, do things because: “you must” OR “it is what’s best, because of…”</li>
</ul>
<p>When speaking of trade-offs, cost evaluation is key, BUT cost isn’t about money, it is about resources in general(including profits, that won’t be made, because change isn’t done)</p>
<ul>
<li>also remember about societal cost, which is crucial at scale</li>
<li>remember, that engineers’ happiness is key metric as well</li>
<li>be data driven, BUT always evaluate data and all underline pros/cons, DON’T just trust it</li>
</ul>
<p>When taking a decision, consider such process, as an example: if I do change X, that will take 2 weeks of my time, gain Y RAM benefit and K CPU loss, will it be beneficial AND, if so, is it the best thing I can spend my time for</p>
<ul>
<li>it is important for company, to share some cost numbers, so it is easy to do calculations</li>
</ul>
<p>Some decisions can’t be based on measurements, because underlying things are unmeasurable, thus experience AND knowledge + some practices can help to do estimations</p>
<p>Remember, that some decisions may backfire unexpectedly, ex: google built a distributed build system to speed-up build-times, SO engineers bloated dependency lists of their apps(because it is not too much slower anymore to add new stuff in)</p>
<ul>
<li>policies and constraints was added later, to mitigate this problem</li>
</ul>
<p>To fork or not to fork</p>
<ul>
<li>benefits: control over dependency, possibility to fine-tune to specific needs</li>
<li>problem: you now a maintainer, so scalability and sustainability suffers</li>
<li>general solutions:
<ul>
<li>if it is short project - fork to move faster</li>
<li>if it is timeless project, be careful with forks AND, if forking, keep interface same/similar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="making-mistakes">Making mistakes</h6>
<p>It is ok to make wrong assumptions OR decision, it is bad not to admit them</p>
<ul>
<li>even if decision is data-driven, data can change, so change in direction is needed too</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture">Culture</h2>
<h4 id="how-to-work-on-teams">How to work on teams</h4>
<p>Software engineering is all about team work and collaboration, so it is important to build related processes well, BUT you need to align your behavior first and then try to “fix” others</p>
<p>People problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>insecurity - people don’t like to share work in progress, because it might reveal smth bad about them
<ul>
<li>it can also lead to stolen ideas</li>
<li>hiding WiP code is harmful, because:
<ul>
<li>you can’t be sure, that you are on right track
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Many eyes make sure your project stays relevant and on track</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>knowledge sharing is non-existent</li>
<li>it is impossible to get external help</li>
<li>it blocks “shift left” / early detection of problems</li>
<li>your project will die, if you stop working on it, because there is no other contributors
<ul>
<li>that’s why you need co-owners AND docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>genius problem - people want to be seen as geniuses/idols in there field
<ul>
<li>you must remember, that always behind big names there is a group of talented people, that was organized by BigName, but we can’t credit only leader of a group</li>
<li>this can often lead to stealing credit for group work OR just been a jerk, which is bad and only sabotages development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>socialization - if people placed in large groups, no one will speak, if people isolated, no on will speak</li>
<li>impatience - be patent with each others ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>main pillars of human interaction and collaborative work:</p>
<ul>
<li>humility - you aren’t center of universe or perfect in any sense, always improve</li>
<li>respect - treat people and their achievements with genuine care and appreciation</li>
<li>trust - trust that people competent AND can do work by themselfs</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>this pillars are important, as prevention of complex situations in human relationships. It is a way to make messy humans to interact easier</li>
<li>why? such “small” things will make playing social game easier, thus creating strong relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>how to achieve pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>loose your ego, BUT leave self-respect</li>
<li>build team ego, by sharing accomplishments</li>
<li>don’t try to be main character in the room, even if you owner of some secret knowledge</li>
<li>learn how give and take criticism:
<ul>
<li>NEVER criticize personal stuff</li>
<li>be constructive</li>
<li>make criticism lead to changes</li>
<li>be polite</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>don’t take criticism personally</li>
<li>remember that you != your code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>failuers:</p>
<ul>
<li>innovation and risk MIGHT and often WILL result in failure, AND it is ok
<ul>
<li>but, remember to fail as early as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>good way to make failure result in something is doing a postmortem(analysis of situation), BUT it must be good:
<ul>
<li>don’t be pointless</li>
<li>don’t be juts to excuse</li>
<li>include explanation of what went wrong AND what is going to change
<ul>
<li>this must be followed along</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>common structure: summary, timeline, root cause, impact, action items and their owners to execute, actions items to prevent future problems, learned lesson</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is ok to change your mind, BUT don’t do it to often
<ul>
<li>the best way it to listen, before acting, thus you won’t discover and change too often in other’s eyes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>let others influence you AND you will be able to influence them</li>
<li>choose your battles wisely</li>
<li>don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” OR “I made a mistake”
<ul>
<li>you collab with your team, NOT compete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>find a culture and work style fit
<ul>
<li>ex: it you can’t work remotely efficiently, just don’t</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>be googley:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to solve problems in hard and non-deterministic environments</li>
<li>value feedback</li>
<li>change status quo</li>
<li>put the user first</li>
<li>care about team</li>
<li>do the right things, even if it is hard</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="knowledge-sharing">Knowledge sharing</h4>
<p>Collectively, organization must always know domain better, than external people, BUT to achieve this org must have experts to have initial knowledge AND mechanisms to share it, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>culture of asking &#x26; answering questions</li>
<li>writing docs</li>
<li>knowledge sharing events</li>
<li>culture of learning</li>
<li>culture of admitting that you don’t know smth</li>
</ul>
<p>challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>fear of been seen as stupid</li>
<li>knowledge fragmentation between teams, that leads to:
<ul>
<li>incomplete general picture</li>
<li>information duplication</li>
<li>several ways of doing same thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>culture of “let me do this for you, because it is faster”
<ul>
<li>results in single point of failure, where single person holds all the knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parroting - people mimic behavior of other, without knowing the reason
<ul>
<li>ex: using patterns, just because</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>graveyards - people afraid to touch some part of code OR practice, because it can lead to problems</li>
</ul>
<p>philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>all people start as beginners</li>
<li>”I will do it for you” doesn’t scale</li>
<li>single point of failure is always a problem</li>
<li>documentation scales well, BUT it must be maintained and can be not sufficient for edge-cases of learning
<ul>
<li>docs help avoid tribal knowledge</li>
<li>knowledge holders will still be needed, because they can point to right docs OR right person, actualize docs, help with edge-cases, BUT they can’t be main point of information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>learn continuously</li>
</ul>
<p>how to overcome challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>psychological safety
<ul>
<li>embrace process of trial and error</li>
<li>assign mentor per each newcomer(ideally mentor can’t be a direct manager, tech lead or peer)
<ul>
<li>mentor must have enough knowledge</li>
<li>mentor is first person to ask, if you don’t know smth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>facilitate asking questions AND will to answer them
<ul>
<li>this is even more important in group context, so person won’t be afraid to ask question AND someone will answer, without been attacked by other peers</li>
<li>to do so:
<ul>
<li>don’t be surprised about question</li>
<li>don’t be biased towards person OR try to assault</li>
<li>guide in proper direction</li>
<li>be patient</li>
<li>try help and not showing off</li>
<li>establish discussion</li>
<li>don’t be pedantic</li>
<li>don’t interrupt ongoing discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>always learn
<ul>
<li>ask questions
<ul>
<li>it is ok to struggle a bit, BUT don’t be stuck for too long</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>remember that you can’t know everything
<ul>
<li>seniority != know everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>find environment to learn smth new</li>
<li>figure out the context behind decisions/design/code etc, first ask why and dive deeper AND only then act
<ul>
<li>you can’t act on thing, if you don’t know the reason why/if they are needed</li>
<li>it doesn’t mean that original thing is right</li>
<li>document your reasoning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="community-knowledge-sharing">Community knowledge sharing</h6>
<p>when you find smth new(in general OR from 1-1 session) write it down and share to community</p>
<ul>
<li>this helps preserving knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>there are several complementary strategies, when it comes to knowledge sharing in community:</p>
<ul>
<li>group chat
<ul>
<li>types: topic-based(have large audience), team-based(more specific topics can be discussed, safer for new people)</li>
<li>benefits: you can get fast response for some question + other members can find new knowledge from there</li>
<li>problems: have no structure and such knowledge hard to preserve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>emailing list
<ul>
<li>similar to group chat by benefits, BUT scalability problems can be mitigated, by archiving threads AND indexing them via wiki search engine</li>
<li>problems: slower then chats, can be noisy</li>
<li>notes:
<ul>
<li>remember to refer final answer(if it is several messages, write a wrap-up)
<ul>
<li>this prevents situations, where you don’t know if thread is closed OR just frozen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on personal basis, set-up filters and other automations to deal with email flow, BUT as company, restrict emails to send them to target group, not just “CC @everyone”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q&#x26;A platform
<ul>
<li>similar to emailing list, BUT with additional UI/UX benefits, such as: custom interface, “mark as answered” etc</li>
<li>require additional set-up and maintenance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there are several ways you can teach someone:</p>
<ul>
<li>office hours - events, where engineers gather and discuss some question/problems
<ul>
<li>problems: problematic to organize, sometimes people don’t know what to ask OR some questions hard to discuss in such way(specific, urgent etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>talks and classes - events, where engineers teach others somethings new
<ul>
<li>can be even non work related, just for building the community</li>
<li>types:
<ul>
<li>talks - share some knowledge</li>
<li>classes - share some knowledge with active participation in class from audience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when to create talk/class:
<ul>
<li>subject has a lot of demand</li>
<li>subject is stale enough</li>
<li>subject involves teacher AND is hard to self-taught</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>documentation - written knowledge, that has main goal to teach reader smth
<ul>
<li>reasons to contribute:
<ul>
<li>update - you can learn somethings new + learn how to contribute to docs
<ul>
<li>it is same rule, as for refactoring, leave place cleaner, that it was before you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create - if you created some new flow, discovered new things OR just gain valuable knowledge - share it with others
<ul>
<li>locate properly docs, so info can be found easily</li>
<li>ideally, place docs near relevant code OR place links to this docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>good docs must have such systems:
<ul>
<li>comments(can be with auto creation of Jira tasks to fix them)</li>
<li>review and diffing</li>
<li>possibility to mark status of doc(draft, relevant, obsolete etc)</li>
<li>be located OR linkable to code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how to promote docs (it is time consuming process, that will benefit many people in long run, so it is important, BUT may be hard to promote)
<ul>
<li>save time, by pointing to docs, instead of answering</li>
<li>enforce sharing and contribution docs
<ul>
<li>this leads to docs to be noticed, thus leading to moral boost of an author and acts as great incentive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>code - code is written knowledge too, thus making code clear and readable makes sharing knowledge easier
<ul>
<li>docs and comments are boosters of knowledge sharing via code</li>
<li>code reviews are boosters of code quality AND help share new practices between author and reviewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>cultivate knowledge sharing as culture via:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect others</li>
<li>create incentives top->bottom:
<ul>
<li>how: make it part of senior position responsibility, make it part of KPIs and review</li>
<li>responsibilities: become mentor, share knowledge(code reviews, docs, talks, classes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create incentives bottom->top, so person receives acknowledgement from colleges
<ul>
<li>peer bonuses, rating, public “kudos”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>establish canonical source for important info</p>
<ul>
<li>prevents information fragmentation, BUT it is harder to maintain</li>
<li>such docs MUST be owned and provide an option for feedback, that will be changed by owners directly</li>
<li>such docs can be team, office, org etc based too</li>
<li>subtype is dev-guide docs, that can provide insights on how-to develop, what style or tooling is used etc</li>
</ul>
<p>tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish short, stable urls for docs
<ul>
<li>ex from google is “go/”, redirect to URL service, that easy to remember+link and will be always stable, even if underlying url has changed, like <code dir="auto">go/python</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if possible, consider creating learning platform</li>
<li>automate some knowledge, via shared linter/prettier configs</li>
<li>big to small updates must be shared, so author gets acknowledgement AND people can find new info, this can be done via:
<ul>
<li>newsletter
<ul>
<li>note: never spam with letters, keep only relevant info in them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>communities
<ul>
<li>creating communities prevents info fragmentation</li>
<li>note: each community can have different level of formality OR even be non work related</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="code-reviews">Code Reviews</h6>
<p>google’s practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>be picky with first couple reviews of new hires, to establish best practices of how code is written in company, thus preserving it’s consistency</li>
<li>for important MRs, require check from certificate person, that has deep domain and language knowledge to make a review
<ul>
<li>such reviewers act as teacher, when reviewing code</li>
<li>discussion is welcomed</li>
<li>such process is great for docs sharing and explaining</li>
<li>be aware that such process is hard to scale, BUT it is worth tradeoff, to achieve knowledge sharing AND consistency
<ul>
<li>part of this process can and should be automated with tooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="software-that-enables-greater-good">Software that enables greater good</h4>
<p>As said before, one of key values, that engineer can have is to respect users of it’s product fully and equally</p>
<ul>
<li>remember to think as your user would</li>
</ul>
<p>all people have some bias by default, often an unconscious one</p>
<ul>
<li>if you don’t have enough representment of each group in your company, it will be biased too
<ul>
<li>Google’s ex: image recognition algorithm, at some point, didn’t recognized black people as people, because of poor training data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>still, bias is expected, when targeting specific auditory
<ul>
<li>BUT, if you have enough market share, underrepresented groups are great targets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>such problem can lead to loosing reputation &#x26; market share</li>
</ul>
<p>how to prevent bias:</p>
<ul>
<li>trainings</li>
<li>proper distribution of stuff AND equal opportunity
<ul>
<li>this will also bring a flow of people to your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>always remember your target audience</li>
<li>recognize and work toward fixing biases</li>
<li>use proper data-sets</li>
<li>always question current and future decisions</li>
<li>listen for feedback AND be data-driven in your approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>remember about:</p>
<ul>
<li>phycological safety of each one in the team</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="leading-a-team">Leading a Team</h4>
<p>Group of individuals is dysfunctional without a leader, BUT leader can be not one
For teach team it is beneficial to have two leaders, with same goals, BUT different perspectives and skill: Manager(PM), Teach Lead</p>
<ul>
<li>team will be dysfunctional, because it will has no aim to move to</li>
<li>this is important chapter of individual contributors too, for better understanding of your management</li>
<li>both roles can be taken by same person, for smaller teams</li>
</ul>
<p>PM - role that responsible for aligning company goals with engineering happiness, do plannings etc</p>
<ul>
<li>individual and company goals might not align, so it is hard job</li>
<li>ideally, product must have engineering background</li>
</ul>
<p>Teach Lead - highly technical role, that manages any large tech decision, priorities, tech level of teammates, in scope of the team</p>
<ul>
<li>lead can be IC too, BUT it is often more beneficial to delegate
<ul>
<li>especially on scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TL+PM - acceptable only for small teams, otherwise person won’t perform good enough</p>
<p>Remember, that it is possible to influence large amount of people, BUT don’t be authoritarian, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>speaking</li>
<li>explaining and aligning goals</li>
<li>be human, respectful and trustful to everyone</li>
<li>not micro-managing</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="how-to-be-a-managerlead">How to be a manager/lead</h6>
<p>You don’t have become manager, BUT it may happen so, thus it is helpful to know how to transition</p>
<p>problems with management:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is hard to quantify what manager does
<ul>
<li>to fix, remember that team efficiency AND happiness is what you do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bad managers make look all managers bad
<ul>
<li>learn how-to, try and decide wether you like been a manager AND then fully promote</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>why to become:</p>
<ul>
<li>you limited in amount of code, you can write, BUT you can stere many people under you</li>
</ul>
<p>problems of managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>micromanagement</li>
<li>ignoring low performing teammates</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>remember, NEVER over-manage people, try serving your people
<ul>
<li>otherwise you will loose hard to replace workers, that can’t work in such atmosphere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>don’t forget about social aspect of a team</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>patterns of bad managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>hire people that will be less smart or less ambitious then you, so you will be more important and more irreplaceable as their leader
<ul>
<li>problems: now team can’t operate without you AND overall results are bad</li>
<li>overall, try to hire people smarter then you, they can replace you AND will challenge, BUT now you AND your team can grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ignoring long performers, because it is hard for you to fire them
<ul>
<li>problem: team will loose in performance, motivation etc</li>
<li>to deal: set-up timeframe, set-up measurable goals, set-up status check-ups
<ul>
<li>it is ok to micromanage, BUT with respect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ignoring human aspect of the managing people</li>
<li>try to be friend with everyone
<ul>
<li>problem: your subordinates will fill obligated to be your friend, because you are a boss + it is hard to be harsh with your friends</li>
<li>better to keep most relationships on the work side of spectrum PLUS some informalities put into it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>compromise hiring bar for speed
<ul>
<li>problem: team quality degrades, it is costly to hire bad person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>treat your team as babies, by micromanaging, don’t trusting, disrespect, not giving opportunities etc
<ul>
<li>problem: people behave, as they are treated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>patterns of good manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>loose your personal ego, BUT still have self-respect and self-confidence
<ul>
<li>cultivate team ego</li>
<li>to achieve: trust people, guide people not take their hand and walk to the destination along with them</li>
<li>respect constructive criticism</li>
<li>apologize</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mediate your emotions
<ul>
<li>you must let people know that you know the problem, BUT you can’t overreact</li>
<li>your reaction will be mirrored by your team</li>
<li>remember, you been constantly watched by your team</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>don’t try to find solution, help person in finding it</li>
<li>be a catalyst, by speeding-up the process, BUT not acting in it
<ul>
<li>as a leader, your goal is to build a consensus (ideally by team-member’s hands, BUT, if needed, you can do it yourself)</li>
<li>look for roadblocks, it is often your responsibility to help with them
<ul>
<li>often, knowing the right person is a key, SO build a network inside your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>remember to also be a mentor
<ul>
<li>junior will take more time to develop smth, it is ok, it will scale your team in future</li>
<li>to be mentor you need to: know the process, be able to explain smth, give just enough needed information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>set clear goals
<ul>
<li>set goals -> let people execute -> check if everything moves in right direction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be honest
<ul>
<li>tell that you don’t know smth OR can’t tell</li>
<li>give proper feedback, even if it is bad
<ul>
<li>don’t use techniques like compliment sandwich, it is better to say things as is, BUT include emphasis
<ul>
<li>without emphasis person will go into defense mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make your team happy
<ul>
<li>first and most important, ASK people what they need</li>
<li>explicitly care about people, their careers etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>lower pressure, when persons have personal problems
<ul>
<li>BUT, it is ok to ask them for “compensation” later</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>tips &#x26; tricks</p>
<ul>
<li>delegate, BUT dirty your hands too</li>
<li>seek replacement
<ul>
<li>to do: hire people smarter then you, create opportunities to tru “manager shoos”</li>
<li>why: you can grow this way</li>
<li>DON’T force ICs to become managers, just because</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>act as quick as possible in some situations, like: low performers, bad hiring process etc</li>
<li>shield you team from chaos, BUT keep them informed, when needed</li>
<li>provide positive feedback too</li>
<li>if something can be easily undone - say “yes” to it</li>
<li>remember that everyone is different AND needs different approach
<ul>
<li>it mostly comes to: motivation, direction</li>
<li>giving direction is about finding what needs to be done AND breaking it into smaller parts, that can be assigned to each teammate</li>
<li>givning motivation
<ul>
<li>focus on intrinsic motivation, by providing:
<ul>
<li>autonomy</li>
<li>mastery - provide possibilities to improve</li>
<li>purpose - help seen the purpose in person’s work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="leading-at-scale">Leading at Scale</h4>
<p>When you start leading one team it is natural progression to lead several teams, so this chapter talks about it</p>
<ul>
<li>all best practices from before apply ;)</li>
<li>larger scale == higher scope == less engineering knowledge used</li>
</ul>
<p>three always of leading:</p>
<ul>
<li>always be deciding - you will take more and more decisions, that must be evaluated by tradeoffs
<ul>
<li>focus on finding the pass, that engineers can follow to achieve something</li>
<li>to decide:
<ul>
<li>identify the blinders - if progress on decision was made before, gain knowledge about the problem AND identify what blind spots was left by people</li>
<li>find and explain, to everyone involved, tradeoffs</li>
<li>make a decision AND iterate upon it(identify the blinders, find tradeoffs, make a decision again)
<ul>
<li>always iterate, don’t seek perfect solution</li>
<li>notes:
<ul>
<li>some tradeoffs can be represented as triangle, where you can only pick two</li>
<li>search for all tradeoffs, even if some thing seems like it is not a tradeoff at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>always be leaving - build processes to work autonomously without you, so you could leave and work on a new problem
<ul>
<li>all teams must be self-driving, basically by having good leadership, healthy engineering processes AND positive culture</li>
<li>to achieve this:
<ul>
<li>divide the problem space - build loose organization structure, so you could divide problem to subproblems, BUT keep things flexible, so each team could iterate and communicate with each structure
<ul>
<li>each team must have sense of progress, ownership and accomplishments</li>
<li>make team own problem, not solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>delegate subproblems to leader, let them fail and iterate
<ul>
<li>always ask if you really the only one who can fix it</li>
<li>also ask yourself what I can do that others can AND fill such areas with other leaders
<ul>
<li>it is not always possible for some tasks tho</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iterate by adjusting processes and teams
<ul>
<li>alternatively you can grow further in career ladder</li>
<li>don’t micromanage, focus on small, but critical adjustments
<ul>
<li>always listen to people</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anchor team’s identity by assigning problems to them, not products(product is solution, that can be changed overtime, making team loose identity AND defeat the solution, instead of iterating upon better one for the problem)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>always be scaling - scaling the team is important, but everything discussed prior results in scaling, SO here will be talked about scaling yourself, meaning proper management of personal time and resources
<ul>
<li>it is common thing, when finishing the project, to gain additional project as result
<ul>
<li>one success results in discoveries in adjacent areas AND more scope to handle with same amount of people</li>
<li>basically you need to handle more to scale, BUT hiring can’t keep-up, so you must know how to compress prior problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>main problem is that, with scope growth you become more and more reactive on stuff that is “thrown at you”, SO differentiate urgent from important by:
<ul>
<li>delegating</li>
<li>scheduling dedicated time to respond OR to do important
<ul>
<li>based on your role, more time to do for IC and more time to respond for manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>track tasks through some system</li>
<li>just drop incoming request
<ul>
<li>you will do it anyway, because there are too many of them, so do it intentionally</li>
<li>one strategy is to breaking things into three groups: 20% of non-important, 60% of somewhat-important, 20% of important; drop 80% and focus only on what is important
<ul>
<li>60% will be either picked-up OR go back to top 20%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>focus on protecting your energy
<ul>
<li>partially you will adapt to work speed over time, BUT it is also important to be proactive here, so:
<ul>
<li>take real vacations - take week+ vacations AND avoid most of contacts with work</li>
<li>don’t mix personal and work -don’t take laptop to home, disable notifications on phone etc</li>
<li>take breaking when working</li>
<li>take sick leaves AND mental health day-offs when needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="measuring-engineering-productivity">Measuring Engineering Productivity</h4>
<p>To be fully data-driven focus on engineers productivity too</p>
<p>why?</p>
<ul>
<li>scaling team is a way to scale company, BUT growth is not linear, because of overhead, SO by scaling individual engineers you scale company in linear-ish fashion</li>
</ul>
<p>note: it must be done naturally AND at adequate cost</p>
<p>process:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify what need to be measured
<ul>
<li>it takes time, resources, makes team slower OR behave unnatural, when measuring, so you need to measure only what is needed</li>
<li>always ask:
<ul>
<li>what result is expected? - to prevent biased results</li>
<li>what actions will be taking if result is positive/negative? - to check if it makes sense to measure something, that will not result in any change
<ul>
<li>change can also mean maintaining status quo</li>
<li>sometimes you can identify what really will result in change AND measure that thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>who will take an action and when?
<ul>
<li>responsible person must be assigned</li>
<li>action must be based on relevant data, so time is important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>do you trust this [source of data]?
<ul>
<li>seek for qualitative or/and quantitative analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it is ok not to measure when change:
<ul>
<li>is to costly</li>
<li>is irrelevant, because of other incoming changes</li>
<li>is going to be made anyway</li>
<li>can’t be measured precisely</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>what metrics to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>one possible framework is Goals->Signals->Metrics, where
<ul>
<li>Goal - what you wan’t to know, not how
<ul>
<li>this must be a full list of goals, that covers all trade-offs</li>
<li>common areas to consider:
<ul>
<li>code quality</li>
<li>attention of engineer(flow state, notification distraction, context switch)</li>
<li>intellectual complexity(base complexity, unknown unknowns)</li>
<li>tempo and velocity</li>
<li>satisfaction</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Signal - how would you know that result is achieved
<ul>
<li>signal can be thing that we want to measure, but it is impossible</li>
<li>it is needed to establish signals first to prevent using only available measurements, think what ideally you would need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metric - basically a measurable alternative to Signal
<ul>
<li>something close enough, that can be viewed as signal</li>
<li>by defining what to measure upfront AND that this thing is suitable for our needs, we can prevent doing additional metrics after the result and the result will be more trustable</li>
<li>metrics can be combined to find deeper details about signal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>framework allows us to understand what we measure AND why, by providing traceability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>data</p>
<ul>
<li>you can collect data in two ways:
<ul>
<li>quantitative - collect as much as possible, BUT with small insight</li>
<li>qualitative - collect rather small sample, BUT with reach insights</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>action</p>
<ul>
<li>after measurements are done TAKE ACTIONS, try to keep them tool-driven, so it is good tools that force processes, NOT just recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>centralized “data team” can be much more effective that forcing each team to do their own data research</li>
<li>if qualitative metric don’t match quantitative -> quantitative is incorrect in some way</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processes">Processes</h2>
<h4 id="styleguides-and-rules">StyleGuides and Rules</h4>
<p>Define set of strict rules, that aren’t negotiable AND guidances, that are recommendations</p>
<p>StyleGuides:</p>
<ul>
<li>treat your style guide as combination of style(prettier) AND conventions(linter)
<ul>
<li>conventions must be strict and understandable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>main goal is clear, sustainable code</li>
<li>it is important to lean towards reuse of industry standard rules, BUT creating something in-house, as addition is important sometimes</li>
</ul>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>to encourage good and discouraged bad behavior
<ul>
<li>good and bad is aligned with company goals and can differ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to establish common language AND patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the Rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>ask what goal you need to achieve AND why</li>
<li>google approach is to create strict rules, that will be less flexible, BUT more oriented towards time sustainability and disallow arguments between engineers on how to do things, so here are common themes in their rules
<ul>
<li>pull their weight - add only important rules, that can be less known to avoid mental overhead AND unnecessary large amount of rules</li>
<li>read-first - code is written once, read many times
<ul>
<li>proper names, easy to follow flow of code, easy to understand intent and what is happening, clear API contracts and abstractions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>consistent - tooling, conventions etc must be kept consistent for ease of adoption
<ul>
<li>engineers spend less time on thinking about how to do things</li>
<li>code is universally readable</li>
<li>scale: easier to refactor, easier to provide tooling, less time-to-learn when changing teams or working in different codebases</li>
<li>ideally adopt all old code to new standards, BUT ideal consistency costs too much
<ul>
<li>use code-generation tooling to do migrations</li>
<li>one solid choice is to enforce consistency on each level first and then on level higher: file, team, project, monorepo, company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be, as much as possible, consistent with external community of devs
<ul>
<li>it is great longterm thinking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>avoid error-prone and hard to understand constructs - prevent hard to understand things from appearing in codebase
<ul>
<li>if you understand it !== other people understand them now OR still will in future</li>
<li>easy code easier to debug</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be practical
<ul>
<li>if performance is critical, be inconsistent</li>
<li>if you use external lib, let it be inconsistent, it is not owned by you</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What style guide should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>rules to avoid danger
<ul>
<li>outline what functionality of language should or shouldn’t be used from technical perspective</li>
<li>prevent common errors and problems</li>
<li>provide pros+cons and rationale for rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rules to enforce best practices
<ul>
<li>provide best practices to keep codebase healthy, maintainable and consistent</li>
<li>improve readability of code</li>
<li>prevent new language features and libraries from getting adopted too soon
<ul>
<li>first study it on small scale AND only after go for broader adoption</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rules to force consistency
<ul>
<li>this are some rules, that have small to no effect, BUT was chosen to prevent any debate between co-workers
<ul>
<li>ex: tab vs space, 2 vs 4 indentation etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>don’t include in your style guide, BUT remember:
<ul>
<li>don’t be clever</li>
<li>don’t reinvent the wheel</li>
<li>don’t fork codebase</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is important to keep rules up-to-date with industry, language, practical and automated, SO when it becomes a burden to do so, rule can be changed
<ul>
<li>it can’t happen to often, because rate of migrations won’t be realistic at all, SO evaluate each new rule and include reasoning with them for future self(you would be able not only understand why to keep, BUT also see if rationale no longer valid)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reason for change must be real, not potential</li>
<li>change must be: necessary or beneficial and relatively cheap to implement + it MUST be agreed on by community first, but finally approved by style guide owner
<ul>
<li>make decision based on trade-offs, NOT preferences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>note that rules CAN and sometimes MUST have exceptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidance (aka the should’s)</p>
<ul>
<li>basically guidance is form of passing collective knowledge of some topic, that doesn’t have to be strictly followed, BUT it is often beneficial to do so</li>
<li>some guidance can be short, in form of a tip that can be read quickly, well remembered, broadly used AND even shared as daily/weekly advice</li>
<li>some guidance can be just a reference/link/example, that can explain some hard topic
<ul>
<li>links for internal lib docs is great way to reduce duplication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>types:
<ul>
<li>social:
<ul>
<li>docs - keep them up-to date</li>
<li>classes</li>
<li>code reviews</li>
<li>spreading rules via some info-channel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>technical: linter, prettier, compiler etc
<ul>
<li>such tools will make process of enforcement scalable and predictable</li>
<li>some problems are purely social and vaguely defined, so it is impossible, costly or will result in flacky results</li>
<li>allow some rules to be chosen on per-project basis, if they aren’t strict</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="code-review">Code Review</h4>
<p>Code review is process of review changes to codebase, but non-author of change, before merging this change to codebase</p>
<ul>
<li>this can be interpreted in different ways, in Google this means that everyone is involved in process AND every change is involved too</li>
<li>basically you need process(this chapter) AND tooling(later on)</li>
</ul>
<p>process:</p>
<ul>
<li>if code is comprehensible and can be well understood by reviewer -> LGTM from any reviewer</li>
<li>if code has LGTM + it is appropriate -> approve from code owner(gate keeper of some codebase)</li>
<li>if code has LGTM + it compiles with style guide -> readability approve from readability expert</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>self-review, more that one LGTM, review from single person who is readability expert and codeowner is used to add flexibility and scalability to process</li>
<li>owners - keeping small number of documented, inside some file, codeowners, that act as gate keepers for some particular part of code, is a great way to introduce strict control for quality to each individual part, because it guarantees review from domain expert
<ul>
<li>such files is great way to document</li>
<li>by maintaining tree-like structure you could easily manipulate code on different levels, BUT don’t bother too much people for review</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>benefits - while common benefits are understood, it is important to look deeper AND maintain important role of reviews, keep it as part of culture(not just nice sanity check, that is actually LGTM)</p>
<ul>
<li>code correctness:
<ul>
<li>check for: structure, design, bugs, tests, efficiency etc</li>
<li>the earlier you find bug the cheaper it would be</li>
<li>comments can’t be opinionated(AT LEAS PRETEND <code dir="auto">;)</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>comprehension of code
<ul>
<li>basically code review is first every inspection of code, made by someone, other then author, THUS it is a way to understand if the code is comprehendable
<ul>
<li>it is crucial, because code is read more often, than written</li>
<li>from this perspective, reviewer should also be interested in code’s health, meaning been it’s maintainer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>try to view all questions as valid AND worse considering, because they will happen again over time
<ul>
<li>this means that code might be too complex AND would benefit from some change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>code consistency
<ul>
<li>code will be read by others, refactored by automated tooling, SO it not only must be well understood, but also standardized</li>
<li>it is also used to ensure that code is “simple”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>psychological and cultural benefit
<ul>
<li>code review makes author think about greater good, disregarding their own style</li>
<li>also it is a great way to learn and receive criticism
<ul>
<li>so keep feedback itself radical, BUT in natural box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it is a way to mitigate impostor syndrome, by receiving positive feedback</li>
<li>it is a way to prevent too much of cutting corners
<ul>
<li>overall, keep your time to reflect on your changes before review</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>knowledge sharing
<ul>
<li>don’t hesitate to sprinkle some “FYI”s into your review process</li>
<li>process of knowledge sharing is bi-directional</li>
<li>also, using commit+MR+comment combination you can find some clarification on rationale behind the change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>benefits can apply for both sides of process</li>
<li>notes:
<ul>
<li>keep process lightweight enough, so it is scalable</li>
<li>this benefits are so important, that it is worth to slow time-to-production of change rate AND keep this processes rather strict</li>
<li>don’t strive for perfect code, approve if code makes codebase better</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>best practices (required so process is fast and smooth):</p>
<ul>
<li>be polite and professional
<ul>
<li>ask why something is done in such way, don’t go to conclusion</li>
<li>keep discussion professional</li>
<li>accept author’s view, if it has valid points</li>
<li>don’t view code as yours</li>
<li>take your time to explain and argument your point of view ON PER COMMENT BASIS
<ul>
<li>don’t resolve until agreed upon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>give feedback all at once</li>
<li>respond as quick as possible</li>
<li>write small changes
<ul>
<li>it is faster to review</li>
<li>it is easier to understand</li>
<li>review will be more qualitative</li>
<li>BUT, remember that:
<ul>
<li>small changes might hide larger picture</li>
<li>can be impossible (feature flags, trunk based development and proper processes can fix it)</li>
<li>set of small changes can be slower then one large</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>write good description and commit names
<ul>
<li>include all changes into it, BUT keep it small</li>
<li>it will help with bug fixing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>keep number of reviewers low
<ul>
<li>it is just not worse it to have too much people review at once</li>
<li>but if you have several reviewers, try to focus on different things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>automate
<ul>
<li>static analysis, proper CI/CD, tests</li>
<li>you can even reject possibility of review, before all pre-commit checks are green</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>types of review (each type need to be treated differently):</p>
<ul>
<li>new code
<ul>
<li>evaluate if it will stand the time AND scale properly</li>
<li>before any large new code additions do design(or similar process, like: ADR, PRD etc)
<ul>
<li>code must be done by design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>code must be tested</li>
<li>it must have defined owners AND proper docs AND proper CI/CD etc configs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>behavioral changes OR improvements
<ul>
<li>if code deleted - great, if not, check if it is improving the codebase</li>
<li>new code practices apply here too</li>
<li>tests must be green</li>
<li>if change is optimization - provide reasoning AND benchmarks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>bug fixes OR rollbacks
<ul>
<li>fix only found bug AND change tests to account for that bug</li>
<li>any change that can cause a rollback must be easy revertable and atomic</li>
<li>rollback can be also done by effected downstream consumer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refactoring OR large-scale changes
<ul>
<li>some changes are generated by machine, BUT it still must be reviewed
<ul>
<li>low risk - owner of codebase</li>
<li>high risk - owner of codebase + owners of chunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>chunk owner can review only their chunks AND comment only on specifics of their code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>
<p>Docs are important process, that need to be built around proper tooling and processes, so it is easy and scalable to write docs from engineers to engineers</p>
<ul>
<li>lacking docs is often main pain-point in day2day work, THAT can’t be fixed by PM, tech lead or teach writer</li>
<li>without processes it won’t be realistic to achieve good docs, LIKE it was with testing prior</li>
</ul>
<p>documentation is beneficial cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>code is understandable</li>
<li>onboarding is smoother</li>
<li>objectives are clear</li>
<li>it helps with establishing proper API/interface</li>
<li>it helps with non-trivial places</li>
<li>it makes public API looks more professional</li>
<li>you can refer to the docs, instead of re-answering questions</li>
<li>---</li>
<li>benefits aren’t upfront, but will help future your and other maintainers in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>it is hard to write docs, BUT we don’t need to avoid it, we need to invest in tooling</p>
<ul>
<li>make it easy to write docs, BUT docs must be easy to read</li>
</ul>
<p>documentation must:</p>
<ul>
<li>have rules, standards, like code itself
<ul>
<li>in general keep it close to the code(by rules, by location, by content, source control, reviews etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be owned AND maintained</li>
<li>have single source of truth AND avoid duplicates</li>
<li>be easily searchable</li>
<li>evaluate docs from time to time for been actual</li>
<li>be fixable(or at least take tickets to be fixed) by reader</li>
<li>(ideally) docs must be changed alongside the code</li>
</ul>
<p>understand your audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it design document - focus on decision making, if it is guide - focus on explaining topic etc</li>
<li>treat docs as test, not your main activity, BUT very important
<ul>
<li>remember, you don’t need to be great writer, just try your best to express your knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>keep level of explaining acceptable to your audience, BUT, if possible, appeal to broader one</li>
<li>take your time to refine document(remove duplicates, condense etc)</li>
<li>if possible: provide TLDR</li>
<li>keep docs consistent</li>
<li>keep public docs of public API separate from implementation docs</li>
