*notes of Code Complete book (2nd edition) by Steve McConnel* 
*this could by a part of Architecture note, but it is already kinda big :)* 

## Preface

This is a book about nearly every aspect of software development, with many and many examples of code, best practices etc, that came from different source(been white papers or just some new arising tech solutions)
- in its core, all of SE is built upon this practices, no matter the language or environment you are working in

SE includes many parts(testing, building architecture, planning), but the main one is code construction, that is main part of all software development, that can't be avoided or shourtcutted

## Foundation
#### Software Construction
Software construction - process of building/developing software(this includes testing, planning, designing etc, but for the most part it is about creation)
- basically creating a software is complex process, that includes many parts, that may or may not be included in particular process, depending on it's scale, formality etc
- note that detailed design, coding, debugging, integration and testing(manual and automatic) is also a part of development/construction
- why it is important:
	- it is a central part of development cycle
	- code is main source of truth, so it needs to be good
	- construction always needs to be done

#### Metaphors
Creating and learning metaphors in field you are working at is important part in communication, building understanding and creating something new, because it helps to grasp some hard parts by looking at similarities with smth simple
- metaphors can be bad, or just irrelevant, so they are evolving in their own way
- metaphor in software engineering is not about algorithmic approach to something, it is more about general idea, that can lead to some solution(or at list be a guide on how to find it)
	- it is like algorithm vs pattern
	- this comes from fluent and diverse nature of SE
- metaphors can be combined

common metaphors:
- developing software == writing code
	- brings to us that code must be readable, easily understandable, process of developing is built upon trial&error(in a way its true, but we always should account for planning first)
	- not accounts for planning, multiple developers in one project, maintenance, originality(it is better to use pre-existing solution, then imagine new one)
- developing software == doing farming
	- bring to us that we should do a bit at a time(incremental development)
	- not accounts that you still have control in-between process(after you plant seed and harvested the result)
- developing software == accretion
	- bring to us that we should scale system incrementally/iteratively/adaptively, we should form a base first and grow upon it, agile
- developing software == building
	- *(compatible with accretion)* 
	- bring to us that we should:
		- pre-plan
			- how and what we plan can differ, depending on what we are doing(small scale projects can go without planning at all)
		- define a problem, architecture, design, construct, optimize, review, test
			- otherwise, on scale, you will loose a lot of man-hours of re-doing
				- and if you don't re-do, project will become a mess
		- use already created libraries, tools and languages
			- however, some parts can be written in-house to account for needs
		- use different planning approaches(sometimes just general planning, sometimes in-details)
			- this also includes accounting for changes, as development goes
		- be documented
		- be dived into parts, with assigning responsibilities for each one
- applying patterns == using toolbox
	- bring to us that we should use proper tool for each problem

#### Prerequisites
Preparation is key in developing a software, but preparations can differ, depending on requirements
- if no planning is done, only think you can really do is damage control in process of construction

why pre-plan:
- to make your software high-quality, it need to be in a good quality in all phase
	- quality at the end == testing
	- quality at the middle == construction
	- quality at the beginning == planning, designing etc
		- includes: problem definition, planning and designing the solution
		- with bad beginning you can only back-up and re-do
- risk reduction

what can go wrong in planning:
- person don't know how-to do it OR just don't want to
	- if you don't want to, just consider arguments, or fail couple of times on scale :)
- not enough time to do so(strict deadlines, management etc)
	- it is important to find time for planning, with argumentation and arguing for it, here are some ways of how to argue:
		- don't :)
			- quit or "just say it is what it is"
		- pretend that you are
		- try to educate management on why you need to do so(all in all it is also part of your job)
			- appeal to logic - you can't do smth big with no plan
			- appeal to analogy - house building, food chain(bad crop will poison you, eating a cow)
			- appeal to data - more changes later == more money to spend, because we need to rework each affected part(on scale)
				- it is about finding bugs as left as possible on scale of planning -> release
					- its like saying I want to live happily for 50 years of my life and party, than go to the gym(but you can live happily to 100 otherwise)

as said, you need to know your software, to plan properly for it, so, here is guide
- I am too lazy to note all of this, so just know that with more scale and criticalness, you need to do more planning, testing, archetecturing, inspections, formality etc
