*notes of "Software Engineering at Google" by O'Reilly* 

## Preface
It is important to build not only scalable, BUT also sustainable software, that can adapt to potential changes, while been accessible to other devs

This book will also explore the difference between development AND engineering
- software is becoming more and more included into our day2day lives, so it is important to engineer it, not just develop and pray
	- thats for other engineers has practices and standards

Overall, here you can find processes, practices and tools, used by Google to achieve healthy codebase, that explored through this topics:
- effect of time over sustainability
- effect of scale over viability
- design trade-offs

When creating software, remember:
- how code will adapt over time
- how code will scale with business
- what trade-offs can be adapted to scale faster OR grow in more sustainable manner

Main topics will be:
- Google's culture
- Processes at scale
- Tooling (internal AND open-source)

Note, that this is all about the way, how Google operates, not one for all fit list of advices

## What is Software Engineering
As software engineers, we have a responsibility to:
- think about time
- think about scale
- make complex decisions

Basically, development is process of writing code, which, if combined with modification, maintenance and team-work, becomes software engineering
- often you need to decide how long-lived your program will be AND this will result in what will you do(program or engineer)
- if you can't adapt to potential changes, you create high risk situation for yourself
- introducing several devs require process, BUT will benefit in long run

Always remember, that unsustainable practices will introduce deferred cost

###### Time and Change
As said, with scale comes need to adopt for more and more fundamental changes, and, if it is not done before-hand, it WILL back-fire hard, because:
- there are many hidden things, inside program, that will slow-down upgrade
- it is not enough experience overall in this field
- it is long and costly process, where you need to JUST do migration alone
- \---
- to avoid, generally, invest in incremental updates
- focus on possibility to overcome any update forward, not just first one, it is constant battle
- remember that any dependency CAN and most often WILL change(usually because new feature, optimization or bug is found)
- ideally, you need to reduce that cost of change, by paying upfront and investing in it overtime, OTHERWISE you have risk of been stuck in impossible to change state, where you defer to get more resource, but deferring causes more need of them
	- such problems often slowly become worse overtime, until hitting critical point
- never do changes for the sake of change

###### Hyrum's Law
This law states, that no matter what contract defines, giving long enough time period, all observable behavior of public API will be depended-on by user
- ex: if you return internal details in error response, that aren't defined by contract AND stopped, this will break someone, who decided to parse them
- note: we can mitigate it, but never overcome
- when deciding to change something, you must include the cost of mitigating breakage problems
	- it works both ways, ex: when using hash-map you can depend on order of items, BUT if you will it will make your code less sustainable; when changing algorithm behind your hash-map library, you eventually will cause bugs in someones code
	- generally, avoid been "clever", don't depend on implementation, depend on interface

###### Policies
Everything need to scale(codebase, dependencies, machines etc), including policies

Scaling problem can be spotted, if process can't be automated, thus requiring more resources, with more scale
- remember, that scale of smth(ex: codebase) often will produce non-linear resource requirements(ex: number of maintainers), SO automation is even more important

Examples of bad policies and alternatives:
- force dependent teams to do migration -- perform migration by dedicated team OR team of devs, that introduced need for migration
- develop in large branches -- trunk based development

Examples of good policies:
- if breaking change wasn't detected by test suits before merge, this is not a problem of author, this is problem of test owner
- knowledge sharing process
- work on improvements of found problems, not just assume that they won't repeat
	- this will make upstream changes easier and cheaper
- in general:
	- automate
	- isolate low-level details
	- share expertise
	- introduce improvements constantly
	- keep major policies well known

###### Shifting left
It is cheaper to fix early problems, so it is important to invest in tools and polices, that will catch any problems on early stage of development

###### Trade-offs
Have a reason(often backed by data) to do something, don't don for sake of doing OR "just because"
- in general, do things because: "you must" OR "it is what's best, because of...."

When speaking of trade-offs, cost evaluation is key, BUT cost isn't about money, it is about resources in general(including profits, that won't be made, because change isn't done)
- also remember about societal cost, which is crucial at scale
- remember, that engineers' happiness is key metric as well
- be data driven, BUT always evaluate data and all underline pros/cons, DON'T just trust it

When taking a decision, consider such process, as an example: if I do change X, that will take 2 weeks of my time, gain Y RAM benefit and K CPU loss, will it be beneficial AND, if so, is it the best thing I can spend my time for
- it is important for company, to share some cost numbers, so it is easy to do calculations

Some decisions can't be based on measurements, because underlying things are unmeasurable, thus experience AND knowledge + some practices can help to do estimations

Remember, that some decisions may backfire unexpectedly, ex: google built a distributed build system to speed-up build-times, SO engineers bloated dependency lists of their apps(because it is not too much slower anymore to add new stuff in)
- policies and constraints was added later, to mitigate this problem
